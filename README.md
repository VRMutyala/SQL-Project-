# Cement Manufacturing Data Analysis
# Project Overview
This project focuses on performing comprehensive data analysis on cement manufacturing data. It aims to offer insights into various aspects of the manufacturing process, including data cleaning, performance analysis, outlier detection, predictive maintenance, and trend forecasting. The goal is to identify operational inefficiencies, predict maintenance needs, and optimize production processes based on historical data.

## Features
- Data Exploration: Basic exploration of the dataset, including row counts and a preview of the first few records.
- Data Cleaning: Removal of NULL values and duplicates to ensure high-quality data for analysis.
- Descriptive Statistics: Calculation of various statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis) for key variables such as mill TPH and mill KW.
- Outlier Detection: Identification of outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to ensure data integrity.
- Performance Analysis: Correlation analysis between mill power (KW) and production efficiency (TPH), and the impact of temperature on production.
- Real-Time Monitoring: A live data view for monitoring the current operational status and identifying any underperforming periods or abnormal power consumption.
- Alerts & Anomalies: Query-based alerts for abnormal reject rates, high temperatures, or inefficiencies in separator RPM.
- Predictive Maintenance: Predictive maintenance queries to identify equipment that might need attention based on power consumption and operational patterns.
- Trend Forecasting: Monthly analysis of production efficiency and power consumption to identify long-term trends and anomalies.
# Requirements
MySQL Database
SQL environment for running the queries
Basic knowledge of SQL for interpreting the results
# Expected Output
The output of each query will provide the necessary statistics, insights, and alerts for the cement manufacturing process.
This includes:
- Insights into the overall production efficiency.
- Identification of underperforming periods and anomalies.
- Maintenance alerts based on power consumption, temperature, and operational patterns.
- Predictive maintenance insights to optimize equipment performance.
